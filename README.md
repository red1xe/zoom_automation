# zoom_automation
This is the script edited according to my syllabus but you can easily automate the lectures or zoom meetings you have to attend regularly.

All you have to do is create a new function depending on your lecture which contains a zoom link and adding how often to repeat the code at the very end.

If you want, you can create a batch file in the same directory to easily run the python file you wrote.
